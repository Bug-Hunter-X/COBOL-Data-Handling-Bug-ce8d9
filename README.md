This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in COBOL related to data handling. The bug arises from the implicit conversion of non-numeric data types during arithmetic operations, leading to unexpected results and program termination. This example highlights the importance of explicit data type conversion and error handling in COBOL programs to prevent unforeseen issues during program execution.
